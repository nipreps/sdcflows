    r"""
    Set up a workflow that unwarps the input :abbr:`EPI (echo-planar imaging)` dataset.

    Workflow Graph

            :graph2use: orig

            from sdcflows.workflows.apply.correction import init_unwarp_wf
            wf = init_unwarp_wf(omp_nthreads=2)

    Parameters
    ----------
    jacobian : :class:`bool`
        If :obj:`True`, apply Jacobian determinant correction after unwarping.
    omp_nthreads : :class:`int`
        Maximum number of threads an individual process may use.
    name : :class:`str`
        Unique name of this workflow.
    debug : :class:`bool`
        Whether to run in *sloppy* mode.

    Inputs
    ------
    distorted
        the target EPI image.
    metadata
        dictionary of metadata corresponding to the target EPI image
    fmap_coeff
        fieldmap coefficients in distorted EPI space.
    hmc_xforms
        list of head-motion correction matrices (in ITK format)

    Outputs
    -------
    fieldmap
        the actual B\ :sub:`0` inhomogeneity map (also called *fieldmap*)
        interpolated from the B-Spline coefficients into the target EPI's
        grid, given in Hz units.
    fieldwarp
        the displacements field interpolated from the B-Spline coefficients
        and scaled by the appropriate parameters (readout time of the EPI
        target and voxel size along PE).
    corrected
        the target EPI reference image, after applying unwarping.
    corrected_mask
        a fast mask calculated from the corrected EPI reference.
