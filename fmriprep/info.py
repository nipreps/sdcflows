                   "that is robust to differences in scan acquisition protocols and that requires "

__longdesc__ = ("This package is a functional magnetic resonance image preprocessing pipeline "
                "that is designed to provide an easily accessible, state-of-the-art interface "
                "that is robust to differences in scan acquisition protocols and that requires "
                "minimal user input, while providing easily interpretable and comprehensive error "
                "and output reporting. This open-source neuroimaging data processing tool is "
                "being developed as a part of the MRI image analysis and reproducibility platform "
                "offered by the CRN. This pipeline is heavily influenced by the `Human Connectome "
                "Project analysis pipelines "
                "<https://github.com/Washington-University/Pipelines>`_ and, as such, the "
                "backbone of this pipeline is a python reimplementation of the HCP "
                "`GenericfMRIVolumeProcessingPipeline.sh` script. However, a major difference is "
                "that this pipeline is executed using a `nipype workflow framework "
                "<http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. This allows for each call to a "
                "software module or binary to be controlled within the workflows, which removes "
                "the need for manual curation at every stage, while still providing all the "
                "output and error information that would be necessary for debugging and "
                "interpretation purposes. The fmriprep pipeline primarily utilizes FSL tools, but "
                "also utilizes ANTs tools at several stages such as skull stripping and template "
                "registration. This pipeline was designed to provide the best software "
                "implementation for each state of preprocessing, and will be updated as newer and "
                "better neuroimaging software become available.")
