2.7.0 (December 18, 2023)
=========================
New feature release in the 2.7.0 series.

This release includes an updated CLI, which allows ``sdcflows`` to be
run as a BIDS App. To achieve the previous behavior of ``sdcflows-find-estimators``,
use the ``-n`` flag.

Addtional bug fixes and enhancements are included.

* FIX: Drop header before resampling image to avoid unsafe cast (#415)
* FIX: Wrangler now ignores ``part-phase`` EPI files (#407)
* ENH: Standalone CLI now estimates fieldmaps (#408)
* ENH: Add support for ASL data (#411)
* ENH: Enable rendering of the Jupyter notebooks (#409)
* MNT: Migrate to PEP517/518 packaging (#410)
* CI: bump actions/setup-python from 4 to 5 (#412)
* CI: bump conda-incubator/setup-miniconda from 2 to 3 (#406)

2.6.0 (November 10, 2023)
=========================
New feature release in the 2.6.0 series.

This release resolves a number of issues with fieldmaps inducing distortions
during correction. Phase difference and direct fieldmaps are now masked correctly,
preventing the overestimation of distortions outside the brain. Additionally,
we now implement Jacobian weighting during unwarping, which corrects for compression
and expansion effects on signal intensity.

* FIX: Mask fieldmap before fitting spline field (#396)
* FIX: Interpolate to floating point values (#394)
* FIX: Refactoring the ``B0FieldTransform`` implementation (#346)
* FIX: Nipype workflows like to be passed absolute paths (phasediff fieldmap) (#374)
* ENH: Implement Jacobian weighting during unwarp (#391)
* ENH: Output target2fmap_xfm from coeff2epi_wf (#381)
* ENH: Add data loader to sdcflows.data, drop pkg_resources (#379)
* RF: Use scipy.interpolate.BSpline to construct spline basis (#393)

* DOC: Fix missing dependency when merging new data loader (#380)
* MNT: Update emprical values in test to allow transition to new scipy's BSpline (#387)
* MNT: Add pre-commit config (#375)

2.5.2 (November 09, 2023)
=========================
Bug-fix release in the 2.5.x series.

This release includes a fix for phasediff/direct fieldmaps that were previously
producing distortions outside the brain due to an incorrect masking of the fieldmap.

* FIX: Ensure metadata is not present in entity query (#367)
* RF/FIX: Prioritize sbref and shortest echo for SyN-SDC (#364)

2.5.0 (June 01, 2023)
=====================
New feature release in the 2.5.x series.

This release includes a number of changes to default behaviors.
SyN-SDC will be performed per-BOLD/DWI image, unless specified otherwise with
``B0FieldIdentifier``\s, and may now be specified with T2w images as anatomical
references as well.
Additionally, PEPolar fieldmaps will only be grouped if they share ``IntendedFor``
metadata.

Finally, as a small UX improvement, if magnitude1/magnitude2 images have differing
affines but are in register, we will now copy the header rather than requiring the
user to update the header themselves.

* FIX: Ensure IntendedFor metadata is a subject-relative path (#360)
* ENH: Split SyN fieldmap estimates per-EPI (#312)
* ENH: Allow non-T1w anatomical estimators (#358)
* ENH: Function to calculate reference grids aligned with the coefficients (#355)
* ENH: Check registration of magnitude1/magnitude2 images and update headers (#356)
* RF: Split PEPolar fieldmaps by intent, if available (#342)
* CI: Use supported codecov uploaders (#348)

2.4.3 (April 24, 2023)
======================
Bug-fix release in the 2.4.x series.

This fix resolves an inconsistency of treatment of phase-difference and
scanner-calculated fieldmaps, relative to PEPolar and SyN. Fieldmaps in
orientations other than RAS were impacted.

* FIX: Reorient fieldmaps to RAS before estimating B-splines (#354)

2.4.2 (April 20, 2023)
======================
Bug-fix release in the 2.4.x series.

we missed last time.

2.0.0 (January 25, 2021)
========================
The *SDCFlows* 2.0.x series are released after a comprehensive overhaul of the software's API.
This overhaul has the vision of converting *SDCFlows* into some sort of subordinate pipeline
to other *d/fMRIPrep*, inline with *sMRIPrep*'s approach.
The idea is to consider fieldmaps a first-citizen input, for which derivatives are generated
at the output (on the same vein of, and effectively implementing `#26
<https://github.com/nipreps/sdcflows/issues/26>`__).
A bids's-eye view of this new release follows:

* Two new base objects (:py:class:`~sdcflows.fieldmaps.FieldmapFile` and
  :py:class:`~sdcflows.fieldmaps.FieldmapEstimation`) for the validation
  and representation of fieldmap estimation strategies.
  Validation of metadata and checking the sufficiency of imaging files
  and necessary parameters is now done with these two objects.
  :py:class:`~sdcflows.fieldmaps.FieldmapEstimation` also generates the
  appropriate estimation workflow for the input data.
* Moved estimation workflows under the :py:mod:`sdcflows.workflows.fit` module.
* New outputs submodule :py:mod:`sdcflows.workflows.outputs` that writes out reportlets and
  derivatives, following suit with higher-level *NiPreps* (*s/f/dMRIPrep*).
  The two workflows are exercised in the CircleCI tests, and the artifacts are generated
  this way.
  Derivatives are populated with relevant pieces of metadata (for instance, they forward
  the ``IntendedFor`` fields).
* A new :py:func:`~sdcflows.workflows.base.init_fmap_preproc_wf`, leveraging
  :py:class:`~sdcflows.fieldmaps.FieldmapEstimation` objects.
* Separated out a new utilities module :py:mod:`sdcflows.utils` for the manipulation of
  phase information and :abbr:`EPI (echo-planar imaging)` data.
* New :py:mod:`sdcflows.workflows.apply.registration` module, which aligns the reference map
  of the fieldmap of choice (e.g., a magnitude image) to the reference EPI
  (e.g., an SBRef, a *b=0* DWI, or a *fMRIPrep*'s *BOLDRef*) with ANTs.
  The workflow resamples the fieldmap reference into the reference EPI's space for
  reporting/visualization objectives.
* New :py:mod:`sdcflows.interfaces.bspline` set of utilities for the filtering and
  extrapolation of fieldmaps with B-Splines.
  Accordingly, all workflows have been updated to correctly handle (and better use) B-Spline
  coefficients.
* A new PEPOLAR implementation based on TOPUP (see
  :py:func:`sdcflows.workflows.fit.pepolar.init_topup_wf`).
* Pushed the code coverage with tests, along with a deep code cleanup.

.. attention::

    *SDCFlows* drops Python 3.6 starting with 1.4.x series.
